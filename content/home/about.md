# Biography

I joined Melbourne Business School in 2018 as HMSTrust Chair in Social Innovation and Professor of Business Strategy. I work where strategy and innovation intersect. I'm particularly interested in how firms can innovate to address the growing demands that they contribute more broadly to society. My recent work has explored this challenge in the context of clean energy and sustainability.
 
I came to MBS from the Department of Management at Arizona State University’s W. P. Carey School of Business, where I also had a courtesy appointment in the Department of Supply Chain Management. I was named a Senior Sustainability Scholar at ASU’s Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability, an affiliation I maintain, and represented ASU at the Arizona Solar Summit, an industry-government-academia collaboration to develop the state's solar energy industry.
 
Before ASU, I spent 10 years at the University of Illinois as a member of the strategy and international business groups in the College of Business, with additional appointments in the College of Law and the Institute for Genomic Biology as part of the BioBEL (Business, Economic and Legal Aspects of Biotechnology) research group.

My professional experience includes directing research on Japanese business practices and government policy for the law firm Dewey Ballantine, serving as international policy analyst for the National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and--as Japanese information specialist for SCAN C2C, Inc.--performing research on Japanese technology and commerce for clients including General Electric, IBM and Ford Motor Company.

I serve as an Associate Editor for the _Strategic Management Journal_ and the Strategic Management Society’s new _Strategic Management Review_. I am also a member of the Editorial Review Boards for _Organization Science_, _Strategic Organization_ and _Strategy Science_.
 
I am always interested in meeting potential collaborators, so please look around this website to learn more about my activities. You can also read a little more about me on the Melbourne Business School [website](https://mbs.edu/news/sustainable-strategy-expert-glenn-hoetker-joins-me).
