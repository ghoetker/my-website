# Biography

I joined the Department of Management of Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business in 2011, where I also hold a courtesy appointment in the Department of Supply Chain Management. I am also an affiliate professor at the Sandra Day Oâ€™Connor College of Law; Faculty Fellow of the Center for Law, Science and Innovation; and a Senior Sustainability Scholar at the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability. Prior to joining ASU, I spent 10 years at the University of Illinois, where I was a member of both the strategy and international business groups in the College of Business, with additional appointments in the College of Law and the Institute for Genomic Biology, where I was part of the BioBEL (Business, Economic and Legal Aspects of Biotechnology) research group.

My research, teaching and outreach interests are at the confluence of strategy, innovation, and globalization. Much of my recent work has explored these issues in the context of sustainability, particularly clean energy. This website gives an overview of my activities in each of those realms. I am always interested in meeting potential collaborators, so please look around.
