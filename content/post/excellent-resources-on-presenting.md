Presenting is key to success as a management scholar. Presenting your research helps sharpen your thinking (increasing the probability of publication), gains new collaborators, increases others' awareness of your contributions, and ultimately helps build your scholarly reputation. Effective presentation is also a major component of teaching success. So, there are a number of blogs and other resources I follow to give me new ideas on presenting. Not everything in them is immediately applicable to our setting (or even about presenting), but they almost always at least spark thoughts.

Here are some of my favorites.
