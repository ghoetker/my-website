abstract = "We examine the impact of an incumbent firm’s prior experience in strategic renewal on its likelihood of adopting a new technology post-entry, with a focus on incumbents’ relative ability to manage external relationships.  Building on prior work that highlights differences in transformational experience and integrative knowledge possessed by _de alio_ firms—diversifying firms into the focal industry—and _de novo_ firms—firms that are born in the focal industry context—we hypothesize that _de alio_ incumbents will be more likely to switch to the new technology than _de novo_ incumbents.  Further, we examine the moderating effect of prior experience in strategic renewal on the incumbent’s ability to manage external relationships, and hypothesize that _de alio_ incumbents are also better able to leverage their external relationships when confronted with disruptive change than _de novo_ incumbents.  The proposed hypotheses were tested in the context of digital transition in the industry of wireless telecommunications service in the U.S. when the analog incumbents faced challenges from the disruptive digital technology. Empirical results suggest that _de alio_ incumbents are more likely to adopt the new technology than _de novo_ incumbents. Further, _de alio_ incumbents are less affected by the constraints from having a long and a large relationship with existing suppliers in the adoption process than _de novo_ incumbents."
