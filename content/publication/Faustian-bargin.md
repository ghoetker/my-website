abstract = "In an effort to respond to concerns regarding academic rigor expressed in the 1950s, management researchers turned to more established disciplines to help develop a stronger intellectual climate. We examine the evolution of management research over the past 25 years, with a focus on its relationship with the related disciplines of economics, psychology, and sociology. Using citation data for all Academy of Management Journal articles published between 1980 and 2005, we document the temporal changes in disciplinary interlinkages. We discuss the implications of these findings for the current and future state of our field."
