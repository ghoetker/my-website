      <description>Presenting is key to success as a management scholar. Presenting your research helps sharpen your thinking (increasing the probability of publication), gains new collaborators, increases others&amp;rsquo; awareness of your contributions, and ultimately helps build your scholarly reputation. Effective presentation is also a major component of teaching success. So, there are a number of blogs and other resources I follow to give me new ideas on presenting. Not everything in them is immediately applicable to our setting (or even about presenting), but they almost always at least spark thoughts.</description>
