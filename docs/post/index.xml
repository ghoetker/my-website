      <description>A presentation from a panel discussion at the 2017 SMS Doctoral Workshop. It is a slightly updated version of the presentation I gave at the 2003 BPS/OMT/IMD Managing Your Dissertation Workshop, Academy of Management meeting. I’d still agree with what I said then.</description>

      <title>Update to Tools of the trade 1 -- Spelling and grammar checkers</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/update-to-tools-of-the-trade-1/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shortly after I posted Tools of the trade 1—Spelling and grammar checkers, version 3.0 of the Hemingway Editor became available.  The changes are evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, but provide some useful new features. The update is free to owners of version 2, which is generous for an update of this magnitude. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first of a series of posts on &amp;ldquo;Tools of the trade.&amp;rdquo; It will focus mostly on software, although you can see my thought on using a Mac rather than a Windows computer &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/reasons-to-prefer-a-mac&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using Mindmapping software for class preparation</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/mindmap-for-class-prep/</link>

      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/mindmap-for-class-prep/</guid>
      <description>Mindmapping has been around for a long time in various forms and there are many software packages available. In this post, I discuss how I use iThoughtsX to plan my classes. Nothing I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss is specific to iThoughts since many other packages offer similar features. Having tried most of them, I&amp;rsquo;ve found that iThoughts best meets my working style. I especially appreciate its amazing export options and the fact that files move seamlessly from its Mac to iPad versions.</description>

      <description>A presentation from the doctoral workshop at the 2014 West Coast Research Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Along with Kyle Mayer and Anthea Zhang, I addressed the question of “How to keep your research stream going.” My focus was very high-level, really more “How to think about this challenge” than specific recommendations.</description>

      <title>Reasons to Prefer a Mac</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/reasons-to-prefer-a-mac/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a Mac fan since 1984 because, well, I think the Mac OS is more intuitive, stable and enjoyable to use. But, totally aside from that, I think there are three reasons that a Mac may be a better choice for many PhD students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some useful utility programs for Stata</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/useful-stata-utility-programs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll probably spend a lot of your time doing data management and statistical analysis (which you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; doing in Stata, right?). So, small efficiencies in data related tasks can really pay-off in the long run. One way to get those efficiencies is through creating small utility programs that automate tasks that you perform many, many times. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to write short programs for Stata. Below, I offer a few program, each only several lines in length, that I find really useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stata Project Feature</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/stata-project-feature/</link>

      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/stata-project-feature/</guid>
      <description>One of the features of Stata 13 and later is “Projects”, which are meant to provide easier access to multiple files related to a, well, project you are working on. The files can be do files, data, logs, graphs, etc. In fact, they don’t even need to be Stata files. One advantage I have found is that they make it possible to maintain a strict organization of certain types of files going in certain directories, while still having access to all of those files from one pane within Stata.</description>

      <title>Some excellent resources on presenting</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/excellent-resources-on-presenting/</link>

      <description>Presenting is key to success as a management scholar. Presenting your research helps sharpen your thinking (increasing the probability of publication), gains new collaborators, increases others&amp;rsquo; awareness of your contributions, and ultimately helps build your scholarly reputation. Effective presentation is also a major component of teaching success. So, there are a number of blogs and other resources I follow to give me new ideas on presenting. Not everything in them is immediately applicable to our setting (or even about presenting), but they almost always at least spark thoughts.</description>

      <title>Naming variables, especially in Stata</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/naming-variables/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2013 17:38:34 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/naming-variables/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A consistent scheme for naming your variables is very helpful. It makes coming back to a project after it’s been under review for 3 months much easier and is especially valuable when collaborating with someone else. This is one of those points where there are bad practices and good practices, but no &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; practice. More important is consistent project within (ideally across) projects. So, as a starting point for your consideration, here is what I have developed over time, through lots of trial and error. I think this approach make it easy to find variables and understand their provenance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UPDATE OF &#39;&#39;What statistical package should I use?&#39;&#39;</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/what-statistical-package-update-1/</link>

      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/what-statistical-package-update-1/</guid>
      <description>Technological progress continues. In an older posting, I mentioned the role of specialized packages that addressed models not available in the general purpose software, such as LISREL for structural equation modeling (SEM). That example is now somewhat moot, as Stata 12 has an extensive SEM capability and new add-ons for R allow modeling of SEMs. I suspect that if I were a power user, I would find limitations in Stata/R relative to the dedicated packages, but at my level, I haven’t found them.</description>

      <title>A template for Stata .do files</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/template-for-stata-do-files/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2010 14:11:04 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/template-for-stata-do-files/</guid>
      <description>There are many different approaches to writing and documenting the many steps that go into an empirical project. J. Scott Long has a great book, The Workflow of Data Analysis Using Stata, which I strongly recommend. He recommends developing a series of small, highly focused do files, which are run in sequence as needed. I take a different approach, which is keep all of a project&amp;rsquo;s code in one honking large do file, which is divided into sections.</description>

      <title>Excel Is evil</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/excel-is-evil/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2010 13:57:08 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/excel-is-evil/</guid>
      <description>Excel has caused more trouble for more doctoral students than I care to think about. Doctoral students can hurt themselves with Stata in at least two ways (there may be more).
 Using it to clean, combine and otherwise manage data
 Cutting and pasting results into Excel (or worse yet, Word) and then formatting them for presentation
  Both of these a very inefficient uses of time. The first is a disaster for data integrity, because it is hard to document, almost impossible to revise, and very easy to mess up (sort only have the variables, be one row off when pasting, etc.</description>

      <title>What statistical package should I use?</title>
      <link>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/what-statistical-package/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2010 18:12:23 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ghoetker.github.io/my-website/post/what-statistical-package/</guid>
      <description>This is an amazingly contentious question. My first answer is &amp;ldquo;If you are comfortable with a package and it is serving your needs, keep using it.&amp;rdquo; That can be complicated, of course, if you have a co-author dedicated to a given statistics package. If your only need to is pass data back and forth with that co-author, I strongly recommend Stat Transfer, which can convert from pretty much any statistical format to any other.</description>

      <description>A presentation from the doctoral workshop at the 2016 West Coast Research Symposium on Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
A presentation from the orientation session for incoming PhD students at the University of Illinois. My central point was that students should think of the entire PhD experience holistically, rather than as a series of discrete phases, e.g., classes, dissertating, being on the market.</description>
